[![Python application](https://github.com/olumayor99/streamfinity-eks/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/olumayor99/streamfinity-eks/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A deployment of the Streamfinity API to an EKS Cluster using Terraform and Github Actions, and also implementing DevSecOps practices. SCA is implemented with Dependabot, SAST with CodeQL, Terraform tests with Checkov, TFlint, and TFsec.

Still WIP. Re-writing the infrastructure scripts next.
